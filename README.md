Howdy!

This was a deliberately bad implementation of [Boids](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=37401.37406)
for use as an exercise on refactoring...
... now made better by refactoring!

The package you have downloaded can be used to generate an animation of a flock of birds flying around.

To pip install, use the following line in an appropriate command prompt/ bash shell/ terminal:
pip install git+https://github.com/GarlandDA/bad-boids

After installing, the user need only type in 'boids' from the command prompt.

The default parameters for running the simulation are contained inside the configuration file config.yaml, inside the root directory of the repository. The user may modify these as desired.
